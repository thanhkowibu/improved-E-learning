## ADR-001 · Shift from Frontend-Driven Security to Zero Trust / Defense in Depth

**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Phase:** 2C (Module CRUD) → Security Patch  
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

During Phase 2C, the initial implementation of `GET /api/courses/:courseId/modules`
contained the following comment — and the corresponding logic:

```ts
// Auth is optional for GET — let the course-level visibility rules
// in getCourseById govern access.
```

This delegated the access decision for the **module** endpoint to the
**course** endpoint. The assumption was: *"If a user can reach the module
list, they must have already passed the course visibility check."*

This is a **Frontend-Driven Security** pattern — it assumes the client
(browser or app) will always call the course endpoint before calling the
module endpoint, and that the course endpoint's 404/403 response will
prevent the user from ever having a module URL to call.

### The Vulnerability

A direct API call bypasses the assumed call order entirely:

```
GET /api/courses/unpublished-course-id/modules
→ HTTP 200 OK  ← full module tree exposed to unauthenticated callers
```

Any person with a valid `courseId` (obtained from a database leak, a URL
share, or enumeration) could extract the full module/lesson structure of
a draft course without authentication.

### Decision: Zero Trust Architecture at Every Endpoint

Every route handler **independently enforces** its own access policy.
No endpoint assumes that a prior request validated authorization.

The fix adds a **publication gate** directly to every module GET handler:

```ts
const course = await fetchCourseGate(courseId);   // minimal 2-column SELECT
if (!course.isPublished) {
  const caller = await getAuthUser(request);       // may throw AuthError
  if (!isOwner && !isAdmin) {
    return notFound("Course not found or not yet published.");
  }
}
```

The same pattern is applied consistently across the entire API surface:

| Endpoint | Publication Gate | Auth Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/courses/:id` | ✅ Independent | ✅ Independent |
| `GET /api/courses/:id/modules` | ✅ Independent | ✅ Independent |
| `GET /api/courses/:id/modules/:id` | ✅ Independent | ✅ Independent |
| `GET /api/lessons/:id` | ✅ Independent | ✅ Independent |

### Prisma Query Optimisation

The naïve implementation would re-fetch the full course object (all columns)
for every request. Instead, we use a **minimal projection** — a helper called
`fetchCourseGate` that selects exactly two columns:

```ts
// Before (hypothetical naïve version): all columns transferred per row
const course = await prisma.course.findUnique({ where: { id: courseId } });

// After: 2 columns only — isPublished and teacherId
async function fetchCourseGate(courseId: string) {
  return prisma.course.findUnique({
    where: { id: courseId },
    select: { isPublished: true, teacherId: true },
  });
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- The `description` and potential future `content` fields on a course can
  be large. Selecting only the gate fields keeps the check lightweight.
- The Prisma `select` clause translates directly to a SQL column projection:
  `SELECT is_published, teacher_id FROM courses WHERE id = $1`
- This check runs on **every GET request** to a module endpoint, so
  minimising its cost is important for throughput.
- The `fetchCourseGate` function is intentionally **not shared** across
  route files — each file is self-contained and independently auditable,
  which is itself a Zero Trust principle (no implicit trust in shared state).

### 404 instead of 403 for Unpublished Resources

Returning `403 Forbidden` when an unauthenticated caller hits an unpublished
course would **confirm the course exists**. This enables enumeration attacks:
a bot could systematically probe UUIDs and use the 403/404 distinction to
map out the database.

The decision is to **always return 404** for unpublished resources accessed
by non-owners. This is the same pattern used by platforms such as GitHub
(private repositories return 404, not 403, to unauthenticated callers).

### Key Design & Optimisation Decisions Summary

| Property | Frontend-Driven Security (before) | Zero Trust (adopted) |
|---|---|---|
| Access decision location | Client call order assumed | Each route handler independently |
| Failure mode | One bypass = full exposure | Each layer fails independently |
| API testability | Only testable via browser flow | Each endpoint testable in isolation |
| Audit surface | Implicit, distributed across call chain | Explicit, co-located with each route |
| Prisma query cost per gate check | Full row fetch (all columns) | 2-column `SELECT` projection |
| Response for non-owner on unpublished | `403 Forbidden` (leaks existence) | `404 Not Found` (prevents enumeration) |
| Inter-endpoint dependency | High — modules trust course endpoint | None — each route is self-sufficient |

## ADR-002 · JWT Dual-Delivery Strategy (localStorage + HTTP-only Cookie)

**Date:** 2026-05-20  
**Phase:** 1B (Authentication)  
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

JWTs can be stored in `localStorage` (accessible by JS) or HTTP-only cookies
(inaccessible by JS, sent automatically by the browser).

Each has trade-offs:

| | localStorage | HTTP-only Cookie |
|---|---|---|
| XSS risk | **High** — JS can read it | **None** — browser protects it |
| CSRF risk | None — not auto-sent | Mitigated by `SameSite=Lax` |
| Works for API clients (curl, mobile) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No — not auto-sent |
| Works for Next.js middleware (Edge) | ❌ No — no browser | ✅ Yes |

### Decision: Both

The login endpoint writes the JWT to **both**:

1. **HTTP-only `SameSite=Lax` cookie** (`auth_token`) — consumed by Next.js
   middleware for SSR route protection (Edge Runtime has no `localStorage`).
2. **Response body** (`data.accessToken`) — stored in `localStorage` by the
   `AuthContext`, consumed by the `fetch` client for all API calls via the
   `Authorization: Bearer` header.

The `getAuthUser` helper checks the `Authorization` header first, then falls
back to the cookie — supporting both API clients and browser clients with one
implementation.

The cookie TTL and JWT expiry are set to the same value (7 days) to prevent
a state where the cookie is still valid after the JWT has expired.

## ADR-003 · Service Layer Pattern (No Direct Prisma in Route Handlers)

**Date:** 2026-05-20  
**Phase:** 2A (User Management)  
**Status:** Adopted

### Decision

All database operations are encapsulated in `lib/services/*.service.ts` files.
Route handlers call service functions — they never import `prisma` directly
(with the exception of the lightweight `fetchCourseGate` gate check, which is
intentionally kept inline for auditability).

### Rationale

| Concern | Without Service Layer | With Service Layer |
|---|---|---|
| Reuse | Prisma queries duplicated across routes | One source of truth per operation |
| Testing | Must spin up HTTP server to test DB logic | Service functions are unit-testable |
| Password leakage | Must remember `omit` in every route | `omit: { hashedPassword: true }` enforced once in service |
| Ownership check | Duplicated `where: { id, teacherId }` across routes | Centralised in `check-ownership.ts` |

## ADR-004 · orderIndex Auto-Calculation (Append-by-Default)

**Date:** 2026-05-26  
**Phase:** 2C/2D (Module & Lesson CRUD)  
**Status:** Adopted

### Decision

When creating a module or lesson, `orderIndex` is **not accepted from the
client**. The server calculates it as `max(existing orderIndex) + 1`:

```ts
const aggregate = await prisma.module.aggregate({
  where: { courseId },
  _max: { orderIndex: true },
});
const nextOrder = (aggregate._max.orderIndex ?? -1) + 1;
```

Explicit reordering is a separate operation (`PUT /modules` with `{ orderedIds }`),
executed atomically via `prisma.$transaction`.

### Rationale

- Prevents race conditions where two simultaneous POST requests claim the
  same `orderIndex` (at the cost of potential gaps, which are harmless).
- The client never needs to track current ordering state during creation.
- Bulk reorder via ordered IDs array is a clean, idempotent interface that
  maps naturally to drag-and-drop UI interactions.

## ADR-005 · Zod v4 Migration (required_error → error, .errors → .issues)

**Date:** 2026-05-20  
**Phase:** 1B  
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

The project uses Zod **v4.4.3**. Two breaking API changes from v3 affect
all validation schemas and error handlers:

| v3 API | v4 API | Location |
|---|---|---|
| `z.string({ required_error: "..." })` | `z.string({ error: "..." })` | All schema files |
| `ZodError.errors` | `ZodError.issues` | All route handlers |

All schemas and route handlers in this project use the v4 API exclusively.
The `RegisterInput` / `RegisterOutput` split (using `z.input<>` vs `z.output<>`)
was introduced to handle the `role` field's `.default("STUDENT")` making it
optional in the input type but required in the output — a common Zod v4
pattern for forms with default values.

## ADR-006 · Storage Adapter Pattern + Native Web API for File Uploads

**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Phase:** 2E (Material Upload & Management)  
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

File upload in Next.js App Router can be implemented via:

1. **Legacy Node.js middleware** — `multer`, `formidable`, `busboy` + `next-connect`
2. **Native Web API** — `request.formData()` (built into the Fetch API / WinterCG)

Additionally, file storage can be implemented inline (direct `fs.writeFile` in a
route handler) or via an abstraction layer.

### Decision A: Native Web API (`request.formData()`)

All file parsing uses the native `request.formData()` method. No third-party
upload middleware is used.

**Why:**

| Concern | multer / next-connect | Native `request.formData()` |
|---|---|---|
| Compatibility | Designed for Express — requires wrappers in App Router | First-class in Next.js App Router |
| Edge Runtime | Not compatible | Fully compatible |
| Dependencies | +2 packages, CommonJS assumptions | Zero new dependencies |
| Maintenance | Separate ecosystem from Next.js | Maintained by Next.js / WinterCG spec |
| File object type | `multer.File` (Buffer, non-standard) | Web `File` object (WHATWG standard) |

The `File` object from `formData.get("file")` exposes `.arrayBuffer()`, `.size`,
`.name`, and `.type` — all the fields needed for validation and storage, with
no transformation layer required.

### Decision B: Storage Adapter Pattern

All physical file I/O is encapsulated in `lib/services/storage.service.ts`.
Route handlers never import `fs` directly.

**Current implementation** (local filesystem):

```
uploadFile(file, lessonId) → writes to public/uploads/<lessonId>/<uuid>-<name>
deleteFile(fileUrl)        → unlinks from public/uploads/...
resolveFilePath(fileUrl)   → maps /uploads/... → absolute path for streaming
```

**Future swap to AWS S3 — zero route handler changes required:**

```ts
// Only storage.service.ts changes — all callers are unaffected
export async function uploadFile(file: File, lessonId: string): Promise<UploadResult> {
  const buffer = Buffer.from(await file.arrayBuffer());
  const key = `uploads/${lessonId}/${randomUUID()}-${sanitiseFilename(file.name)}`;
  await s3.send(new PutObjectCommand({ Bucket: BUCKET, Key: key, Body: buffer }));
  return { fileUrl: `https://${BUCKET}.s3.amazonaws.com/${key}`, ... };
}
```

### Key Design & Optimisation Decisions

| Decision | Choice Made | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Upload parsing | `request.formData()` (Web API) | App Router native, Edge-compatible, zero new dependencies |
| Middleware | None | multer / next-connect require Express-compatible wrappers |
| Storage namespacing | `public/uploads/<lessonId>/` | Prevents filename collisions across lessons |
| Filename safety | UUID prefix + non-ASCII sanitisation | Prevents path traversal and OS-unsafe character vulnerabilities |
| File size check | `file.size` before write | Fails fast — no partial disk I/O for oversized files |
| MIME type validation | `ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` allowlist before write | Prevents upload of executables (`.sh`, `.exe`, `.php`) |
| DB-write failure | Orphan file deleted (compensation transaction) | Keeps storage and DB consistent on any failure path |
| Deletion order | Physical file first, then DB record | Orphan DB record is recoverable; a missing file with a live record is not |
| Download route | API route (`/api/materials/.../download`) | Enables auth gating, audit logging, and future presigned URL swap |
| Path traversal guard | `absolutePath.startsWith(UPLOADS_ROOT)` | Prevents `../../etc/passwd`-style attacks on resolveFilePath and deleteFile |
| Future storage swap scope | Only `storage.service.ts` | Route handlers, services, validation, and tests require no changes |

## ADR-007 · BigInt JSON Serialization — Global Prototype Patch

**Date:** 2026-05-27  
**Phase:** 2E (Material Upload) — Post-implementation Bug Fix  
**Status:** Adopted

### The Problem: Why BigInt Cannot Be Serialized by Default

JavaScript's `JSON.stringify` (and therefore `NextResponse.json()`) throws
a `TypeError` when it encounters a native `BigInt` value:

```
TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt
```

**Root cause — two mismatched specifications:**

1. **The JSON specification (RFC 8259)** defines numbers as IEEE 754 double-precision
   floats. The maximum safe integer representable is `2^53 − 1 ≈ 9×10¹⁵`.
2. **BigInt** was introduced in ES2020 to represent arbitrarily large integers —
   values that *cannot* be safely round-tripped through a JSON number.
3. **V8 (Node.js engine) deliberately omits a default** `.toJSON()` on BigInt
   to force developers to consciously decide on a serialization strategy, rather
   than silently losing precision.

**Why does Prisma produce BigInt?**

Prisma maps PostgreSQL's `BigInt` column type directly to JavaScript's native
`BigInt` primitive. Our `Material.fileSizeBytes` field is declared `BigInt?`
in `schema.prisma` because file sizes can theoretically exceed `2^31` bytes
(standard 32-bit `Int` max ≈ 2 GB) — a reasonable choice for a media platform.

### The Fix: `BigInt.prototype.toJSON`

`JSON.stringify` calls `.toJSON()` on a value *before* serializing it, if the
method exists. By patching the prototype once, every BigInt in every response
is handled automatically:

```ts
// lib/prisma.ts
BigInt.prototype.toJSON = function (): string {
  return this.toString();
};
```

**Why stringify as a string, not a number?**

Converting `98360n` → `98360` (number) would appear to work for small values but
would silently truncate large values (e.g. a 10 GB file: `10_737_418_240n` exceeds
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and would be corrupted in transit). Converting to a
**string** is always safe and the client can parse it with `BigInt(value)` when
arithmetic is needed.

### Why a Global Prototype Patch vs. Per-Route Casting

Three alternative approaches were considered:

| Approach | Example | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-route casting** | `Number(material.fileSizeBytes)` | Precision loss for large files; must be applied in every single route handler — fragile, easy to forget |
| **Service-layer transform** | Map `BigInt` → `string` in every service return | Requires custom transform types; breaks Prisma's auto-generated types |
| **Custom JSON replacer** | `JSON.stringify(data, (_, v) => typeof v === 'bigint' ? v.toString() : v)` | Must be threaded through every `NextResponse.json()` call — not compatible with the existing `ok/created/...` response helpers |
| **Global `BigInt.prototype.toJSON` patch** ✅ | Applied once in `lib/prisma.ts` | Zero per-route code, works with all existing response helpers, self-documenting, TypeScript-safe via `declare global` |

### Placement Decision

The patch lives in `lib/prisma.ts` rather than `instrumentation.ts` or a
custom `_app.tsx` for two reasons:

1. **Guaranteed early execution** — every database-touching module imports
   `lib/prisma.ts`, so the patch is always applied before any BigInt value
   could reach a response serializer.
2. **Co-location with the root cause** — BigInt values enter our system
   exclusively via Prisma's type mapping. Having the fix immediately adjacent
   to the Prisma client instantiation makes the relationship self-documenting
   and easy to find during future audits.

### Key Design & Optimisation Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Serialization format | `BigInt` → `string` | Prevents IEEE 754 precision loss for values > 2^53 |
| Patch location | `lib/prisma.ts` (module-level, runs once) | Guaranteed execution before any response; co-located with root cause |
| Patch mechanism | `BigInt.prototype.toJSON` | Hooks into `JSON.stringify`'s built-in `.toJSON()` protocol — zero changes to callers |
| TypeScript support | `declare global { interface BigInt { toJSON(): string } }` | Eliminates TS2339 "property does not exist" error on the prototype assignment |
| Scope | Process-global, applies to all BigInt values | One fix covers all current and future Prisma models with BigInt columns |
| Alternative rejected | Per-route `Number()` cast | Silent precision loss for large values; repeated boilerplate in every route |

## ADR-008 · CurriculumEditor — SSR Safety & State Decoupling

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Phase:** 3C (Module & Lesson Management UI)
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

Two independent problems needed to be solved simultaneously when building the Curriculum Editor:

1. **The SSR Problem** — `@uiw/react-md-editor` reads `window` at import-time to detect the browser environment. In Next.js App Router, component modules are evaluated during server-side rendering (SSR). This causes an immediate crash:
   ```
   ReferenceError: window is not defined
   ```
   This is a well-known class of problem with any rich-text editor (CodeMirror, Quill, TipTap, etc.).

2. **The State Coupling Problem** — The Edit Course page already contains a `<CourseForm>` wrapped in `react-hook-form`. If the `CurriculumEditor` were embedded inside the same form's state tree (e.g., as additional fields), every lesson content keystroke would trigger `react-hook-form`'s internal re-render cycle, degrading editor performance and risking form state corruption.

### Decision A: `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` for the Markdown Editor

```tsx
// components/curriculum/LessonEditorDialog.tsx

const MDEditor = dynamic(
  () => import("@uiw/react-md-editor").then((m) => m.default),
  { ssr: false }   // ← never evaluated on the server
);
```

`next/dynamic` is Next.js's built-in code-splitting primitive. When `ssr: false` is set:

- The module is **excluded from the server bundle entirely**. It is never imported during SSR, so `window is not defined` cannot occur.
- The component is loaded **lazily in the browser** after hydration, at the point where it is first rendered.
- A `loading` fallback is rendered during the client-side load gap — here, a simple skeleton with a spinner.

The editor is also wrapped in `data-color-mode="light"` to force a consistent appearance regardless of OS dark mode setting.

### Decision B: State Decoupled from `CourseForm`

`CurriculumEditor` is a **self-contained component** that:
- Fetches its own data via `GET /api/courses/:courseId/modules`
- Maintains its own `modules: Module[]` state
- Is rendered as a sibling of `CourseForm` in the page layout — **not** a child of `CourseForm`'s `<form>` element

This means:
- Changes to lessons (typing in the Markdown editor) do **not** trigger CourseForm's re-render cycle
- Saving a lesson (`PATCH /api/lessons/:lessonId`) does **not** interact with the course form's `isDirty` state
- The two editors are independently focusable and independently submittable

### Key Design & Optimization Decisions

| Decision | Choice Made | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| SSR fix for MD editor | `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })` | Prevents `window is not defined` at import time; excluded from server bundle entirely |
| State location | `CurriculumEditor` owns its own `useState<Module[]>` | Decouples from CourseForm's `react-hook-form` state; prevents cross-component re-renders |
| Lesson reorder UX | Up/Down arrow buttons (not DND) | Avoids nested `DndContext` which crashes with conflicting pointer sensors and event propagation |
| Module reorder UX | `@dnd-kit/sortable` with `PointerSensor` | DND only at the module level; `activationConstraint: { distance: 6 }` prevents accidental drags on button clicks |
| Optimistic UI | Module/lesson order updated before API confirms | Instant visual feedback; original order restored on API failure |
| Markdown editor import | `.then((m) => m.default)` in dynamic | Required when the module uses a default export — resolves the ESM interop correctly |
| `data-color-mode="light"` wrapper | Always use light mode | Prevents jarring dark-mode appearance mismatch when OS is in dark mode but site is light-only |
| Module reorder HTTP verb | `PUT /api/courses/:courseId/modules` | Consistent with the server-side `reorderModules` service (idempotent bulk-replace semantics) |
| Lesson edit URL | `PATCH /api/lessons/:lessonId` (not `/modules/:id/lessons/:id`) | The lesson route is directly addressable; no need to include moduleId in the URL — server resolves it from the lesson record |
| `useApi.put` addition | Added `put` method to `useApi` hook | Mirrors `patch`/`del` — keeps all authenticated fetch calls through one consistent helper with token injection |

## ADR-009 · XMLHttpRequest over fetch for Upload Progress

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Phase:** 3D (Material Management UI)
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

The Material upload UI requires a real-time progress bar so the teacher can see how much of the file has been transmitted. Two browser APIs can perform file uploads from a web page:

1. **`fetch()`** (modern Fetch API)
2. **`XMLHttpRequest`** (legacy, but still widely supported)

### The Gap in the Fetch API

The Fetch API does not expose upload progress. Its `Response` object provides a `body` `ReadableStream` for *download* progress (reading the server response), but there is no equivalent interface for *upload* progress — how many bytes of the request body have been sent to the server.

This is a known, documented limitation. The [WHATWG Fetch specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) does not include upload progress. A `fetch`-based progress bar would require a polyfill or a third-party streaming library (e.g., `axios`), adding a dependency.

### Decision: XMLHttpRequest

`XMLHttpRequest` exposes the `xhr.upload` property, which is an `XMLHttpRequestUpload` object that fires standard `ProgressEvent` events:

```ts
xhr.upload.onprogress = (e: ProgressEvent) => {
  if (e.lengthComputable) {
    setUploadProgress(Math.round((e.loaded / e.total) * 100));
  }
};
```

This is called repeatedly as bytes are transmitted, with `e.loaded` (bytes sent so far) and `e.total` (total file size). The values drive the `<Progress>` component's `value` prop directly — no additional state transformation needed.

### Why Not Axios?

`axios` wraps XHR and also exposes `onUploadProgress`. It is a valid alternative, but adding a ~13 KB dependency purely for upload progress tracking is not justified when the XHR API is built into every browser and already available in our codebase.

### Key Design & Optimization Decisions

| Decision | Choice Made | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Upload API | `XMLHttpRequest` | Only browser API with native `xhr.upload.onprogress` — no extra dependency |
| Auth header | Manually read `lms_auth_token` from `localStorage` and set via `xhr.setRequestHeader` | `useApi` is a hook and cannot be called inside an XHR callback; direct `localStorage` read is the correct pattern |
| Body format | `FormData` with `formData.append("file", file)` | Matches `request.formData()` on the server — browser sets correct `multipart/form-data` boundary automatically |
| Fetch alternative rejected | `fetch()` | No upload progress event in the Fetch specification |
| Axios rejected | Not added | ~13 KB dependency for a single feature; XHR achieves the same result natively |

## ADR-010 · LessonProgress Model & Hybrid Dashboard Data Fetching

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Phase:** 3E/3F (Student Lesson View & Dashboards)
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

During Phase 3E, it became clear that student dashboards and analytics needed a way to track which lessons a student had completed. The original database schema did not include a progress tracking model.

Separately, Phase 3F required choosing a data-fetching strategy for the three role-based dashboards (Student, Teacher, Admin) and the analytics page.

### Decision A: `LessonProgress` Model

A new `LessonProgress` model was added to `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
model LessonProgress {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  studentId   String
  lessonId    String
  isCompleted Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  student User   @relation(fields: [studentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  lesson  Lesson @relation(fields: [lessonId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([studentId, lessonId])
  @@map("lesson_progress")
}
```

**Key design decisions:**
- `@@unique([studentId, lessonId])` — enforces one progress record per student-lesson pair; `upsert` is used for idempotent toggling.
- `isCompleted` boolean (not an enum) — sufficient for the current requirement; expandable to a status enum later if needed.
- Cascade deletes on both `User` and `Lesson` FKs — cleaning up orphan records automatically.

Two API routes were added:
- `GET /api/lessons/[lessonId]/progress` — reads the current student's completion status.
- `POST /api/lessons/[lessonId]/progress` — upserts the completion status (toggle).

### Decision B: Hybrid Dashboard Data Fetching

The dashboards use two different strategies depending on their interactivity needs:

| Component | Strategy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboard/page.tsx` → `AdminDashboard` / `TeacherDashboard` / `StudentDashboard` | Client component (`"use client"`) with `useApi` hooks | Interactive dashboards with role-based conditional rendering; `useAuth` provides the role at runtime |
| `admin/analytics/page.tsx` | Server Component with direct Prisma queries | Read-only analytics page; no interactivity needed; avoids creating a dedicated `/api/admin/stats` endpoint |

**Why no `GET /api/admin/stats` endpoint?**

The analytics page only needs to aggregate data for display. A dedicated stats endpoint would add:
1. A route handler that just wraps Prisma queries with no mutation logic.
2. An additional auth + role check layer (already handled by `getAuthUser()` in the Server Component).
3. Client-side fetch + loading states for data that is available server-side.

The Server Component approach is simpler, faster (no network round-trip), and equally secure (auth checked before any Prisma query).

## ADR-011 · Dual-Layout Chat UI — Standalone Page + Shadcn Sheet on Lesson View

**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Phase:** 5A/5B (AI Tutor Chat UI)
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

The AI Tutor chat needs to be accessible in two distinct user workflows:

1. **Focused conversation** — The student navigates to a dedicated chat page to have an extended Q&A session about the course.
2. **In-context Q&A** — While studying a lesson, the student has a quick question and wants to ask the AI without leaving the lesson content.

A single-page approach would force the student to navigate away from the lesson, losing their reading position. A panel-only approach would lack the space for thread management and extended conversations.

### Decision: Dual Layout with Shared Component Library

Build reusable chat components in `components/chat/` and compose them into **two layouts**:

| Layout | Route / Location | UX Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Standalone Chat Page** | `app/(dashboard)/courses/[courseId]/chat/page.tsx` | Full-page layout with `<ThreadSidebar>` + `<MessageList>` + `<ChatInput>` — for focused, multi-thread conversations |
| **Lesson View Sheet** | `app/(dashboard)/courses/[courseId]/lessons/[lessonId]/page.tsx` | Shadcn `<Sheet side="right">` containing `<ChatWidget>` — slide-out panel so the student can read the lesson and chat simultaneously (NotebookLM-style) |

Both layouts render the same `<ChatWidget>` component, which internally manages thread selection, message fetching, and message sending.

### Component Architecture

```
components/chat/
├── ChatWidget.tsx       # Complete chat experience (composes the below)
├── ThreadSidebar.tsx    # Thread list + create-new
├── MessageList.tsx      # Message rendering with Markdown + auto-scroll
└── ChatInput.tsx        # Input field + send button + keyboard shortcuts
```

### Why Shadcn `<Sheet>` for the Lesson View

| Concern | Modal / Dialog | Shadcn Sheet | Separate Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| Co-visibility with lesson content | ❌ Blocks lesson | ✅ Side-by-side | ❌ Navigates away |
| Implementation cost | Low | Low (Shadcn primitive) | Low |
| Mobile adaptation | Awkward | `side="bottom"` or full-screen | Full-screen |
| State preservation | Lesson state preserved | Lesson state preserved | Lesson state lost |
| Consistent with NotebookLM UX | No | ✅ Yes | No |

The `<Sheet>` component is already available via Shadcn UI and renders as a slide-out overlay that does not unmount the underlying page content. This preserves the student's scroll position and reading context while they interact with the AI Tutor.

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice Made | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Component location | `components/chat/` (reusable library) | Same components used in both standalone page and Sheet panel — zero duplication |
| Sheet trigger | "Ask AI Tutor" button on lesson page | Discoverable but non-intrusive; only visible when `aiEnabled === true` |
| Sheet side | `right` (desktop), `bottom` or full-screen (mobile) | Right panel preserves lesson reading flow on wide screens |

## ADR-012 · UploadThing Cloud Storage Backend

**Date:** 2026-06-08
**Phase:** 6A (Cloud Storage Migration)
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

The LMS currently stores course materials through a local filesystem adapter. That is sufficient for local development, but it is not durable or portable across hosted Next.js deployments, and it complicates future production file serving.

### Decision

Adopt UploadThing as the cloud storage backend for course material uploads. The initial backend setup defines an App Router file router at `app/api/uploadthing/core.ts` and exposes UploadThing's `GET` and `POST` route handlers from `app/api/uploadthing/route.ts`.

The UploadThing route accepts PDF, video, and image uploads. Upload access is limited to authenticated teachers and admins using the existing JWT auth helper.

### Rationale

UploadThing provides a typed Next.js App Router integration, direct-to-cloud uploads, and route-level middleware hooks that fit the existing authorization model. This lets the application migrate away from local `public/uploads` storage while keeping file upload policy close to the API boundary.

## ADR-013 · Quiz Engine Data Model

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Phase:** 7A (Prisma Schema Updates for Quizzes)
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

The LMS needs first-class quiz lessons in addition to lecture lessons. Quizzes require durable storage for quiz settings, ordered questions, selectable options, student attempts, and submitted answers while remaining tied to the existing lesson and enrollment model.

### Decision

Add a `LessonType` enum with `LECTURE` and `QUIZ`, plus a backward-compatible `Lesson.lessonType` field defaulting to `LECTURE`. Model each quiz as an optional one-to-one extension of `Lesson` through `Quiz.lessonId @unique`, with child tables for `QuizQuestion`, `QuizOption`, `QuizAttempt`, and `QuizAnswer`.

Student attempts relate back to `User` through a dedicated `StudentQuizAttempts` relation. Quiz records cascade from their owning lesson, and nested quiz data cascades from its parent quiz, question, option, or attempt as appropriate.

### Rationale

Keeping quizzes as a one-to-one lesson extension preserves the existing course/module/lesson hierarchy and avoids creating a parallel curriculum tree. The `lessonType` discriminator lets existing lecture lessons continue unchanged while future API and UI layers can branch cleanly between markdown content and quiz-taking workflows.

## ADR-014 · Gemini Structured Quiz Generation

**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Phase:** 7E (AI-Powered Quiz Generation)
**Status:** Adopted

### Context

Teachers need a faster way to draft quiz questions from existing lesson markdown and uploaded course materials. The app already uses the Google Gemini File API for grounded course chat, so quiz generation should reuse that backend integration instead of introducing a separate AI client or persistence path.

### Decision

Implement quiz generation through the existing `@google/genai` service layer using `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `responseMimeType: "application/json"`, and a strict array-of-question `responseSchema`. The generation API returns validated question JSON only; it does not create or update quiz records. Teachers review and edit generated questions in `<QuizBuilder>` before saving through the existing quiz CRUD endpoint.

### Rationale

Structured JSON output plus Zod validation keeps generated data compatible with the existing quiz schema and prevents malformed AI output from entering the database. Keeping generation as a draft-only operation preserves teacher control and avoids corrupting quizzes that may already have student attempts.
